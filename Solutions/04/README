README - This file.

Fill.asm - Runs an infinite loop that listens to the keyboard input.
When a key is pressed (any key), the program blackens the screen,
i.e. writes "black" in every pixel;
the screen should remain fully black as long as the key is pressed. 
When no key is pressed, the program clears the screen, i.e. writes
"white" in every pixel;
the screen remains fully clear as long as no key is pressed.

mult.asm - Multiplies R0 and R1 and stores the result in R2.
(R0, R1, R2 refer to RAM[0], RAM[1], and RAM[2], respectively.)
assume R0,R1>=0

Sort.asm - Sorts an array from large to small 
the first index of the array is stored at R14
the length of the array is stored in R15
Selection sort implementation.

Divide.asm - The program input will be at R13,R14 
the result R13/R14 will be stored at R15. discarding the remainder
assumes both numbers are positive.
